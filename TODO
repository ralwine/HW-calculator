CONGRATS! You just started your first project that you cloned from your own repository.
- NO FORKING WAY!!!!

Now put your tail back between your legs and make a TODO!

1. Create your server, public, scripts, vendors, styles folders {x}

2. Create your html, css, client.js, server.js files and bring in jQuery {x}
    -put these in their appropriate folders {x}

3. Bring in package/package lock JSON files and make sure they end up level with the server folder {}

4. HTML - make sure everything is sourced and linked correctly {x}

5. HTML - setup your static HTML {x}
    - SERVER SIDE CALCULATOR header {x}
    - Two inputs for two whole integers with {x}
    - 4 buttons in between (+, -, *, /) {x}
    - 2 buttons at end (=, CLR) {x}

6. Install express and the body-parser modules in the server.js file... make a node_modules folder if one doesn't automatically appear {x}

7. Build as much of the basic communicative framework between client and server as possible before starting logic {}
    - Put listeners on operand buttons {x}
    - Put a listener on equal button {}
    - Put a listener on CLR button (.remove)? {}
    - Create operand functions (don't forget the console.logs!) {}

8. LOGIC... think about this for awhile and ask for help if you get flustered!
    - Let's start figuring out the math functions berfore we put them into their rightful spots. Math functions need to happen on the server side, but are the relevant click events happening there too? The function equals() will effectively send our two numbers over to be calculated in the respective click event. How do we send over the click event with our two numbers from client to server and return our sum? Essentially we are going to send over two numbers with one of four respective click events on the "equals" click event.

    I think we are going to have to change our approach here.. desperate times call for desperate measures!

    ADDITON:

    function add() {
  var num1 = $("#firstNumberInput").val();
  var num2 = $("#num2").val();
  var answer = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2);
  $("#total").val(answer);
}
