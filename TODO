CONGRATS! You just started your first project that you cloned from your own repository.
- NO FORKING WAY!!!!

Now put your tail back between your legs and make a TODO!

1. Create your server, public, scripts, vendors, styles folders {x}

2. Create your html, css, client.js, server.js files and bring in jQuery {x}
    -put these in their appropriate folders {x}

3. Bring in package/package lock JSON files and make sure they end up level with the server folder {}

4. HTML - make sure everything is sourced and linked correctly {x}

5. HTML - setup your static HTML {x}
    - SERVER SIDE CALCULATOR header {x}
    - Two inputs for two whole integers with {x}
    - 4 buttons in between (+, -, *, /) {x}
    - 2 buttons at end (=, CLR) {x}

6. Install express and the body-parser modules in the server.js file... make a node_modules folder if one doesn't automatically appear {x}

7. Build as much of the basic communicative framework between client and server as possible before starting logic {}
    - Put listeners on operand buttons {x}
    - Put a listener on equal button {}
    - Put a listener on CLR button (.remove)? {}
    - Create operand functions (don't forget the console.logs!) {}

8. LOGIC... think about this for awhile and ask for help if you get flustered!
    - Let's start figuring out the math functions berfore we put them into their rightful spots
